# Lead Management Platform (MERN Stack)

A comprehensive Lead Management Platform built with the MERN stack for managing FTD (First Time Deposit), Filler, and Cold leads with role-based access control.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with validation and error handling
- **Security**: Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, input validation

### Frontend (React + Redux + Material-UI)
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with persistence
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI (MUI) components
- **Routing**: React Router with protected routes
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Yup validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd FTD
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm run install-all
```

3. **Environment Setup**
```bash
# Backend environment
cp backend/env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env with your configuration
```

4. **Database Setup and Seeding**
```bash
# Seed the database with default admin user and sample data
npm run seed
```

5. **Start the application**
```bash
# Development mode (runs both frontend and backend)
npm run dev

# Or run separately:
npm run server  # Backend only
npm run client  # Frontend only
```

## 🔧 Development Scripts

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install-all

# Seed database with default users and sample data
npm run seed

# Development mode
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
```

## 🔐 API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user
- `PUT /api/auth/profile` - Update profile
- `PUT /api/auth/password` - Change password

### Orders
- `POST /api/orders` - Create new order (pull leads)
- `GET /api/orders` - Get orders with filtering
- `GET /api/orders/:id` - Get order details
- `PUT /api/orders/:id` - Update order
- `DELETE /api/orders/:id` - Cancel order

### Leads
- `GET /api/leads` - Get all leads (Admin only)
- `GET /api/leads/assigned` - Get assigned leads (Agent)
- `PUT /api/leads/:id/comment` - Add comment to lead
- `PUT /api/leads/:id/status` - Update lead status

### Users
- `GET /api/users` - Get all users (Admin)
- `POST /api/users` - Create user (Admin)
- `PUT /api/users/:id` - Update user (Admin)
- `PUT /api/users/:id/permissions` - Update permissions (Admin)

## 🗄️ Database Models

### User
- Authentication and role management
- Permissions system
- Profile information

### Lead
- Lead type (FTD, Filler, Cold)
- Contact information
- Assignment status
- Document verification (for FTD)
- Comments system

### Order
- Lead requests and fulfillment
- Requester tracking
- Status management

### AgentPerformance
- Daily performance metrics
- Call tracking
- Earnings and penalties

## 🔄 Core Business Logic

### Lead Pulling System
When an order is created:
1. Validates request parameters
2. Uses MongoDB transactions for atomicity
3. Queries available leads by type and status
4. Marks leads as assigned
5. Creates order record with fulfilled counts

### Role-Based Access
- Middleware validates JWT tokens
- Role-specific route protection
- Data filtering based on user role
- Permission-based feature access
